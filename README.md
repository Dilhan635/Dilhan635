## About Me
Creative and detail-oriented video games developer with a passion for crafting engaging gameplay experiences. Recently graduated from Escape Studios University with hands-on experience developing video game projects across multiple platforms - including a finalist project in The Rookies Awards 2025.

Adaptable and proactive in agile environments, with a strong foundation in scripting languages and version control. I’m confident working in Unreal Engine, C++, C#, and Unity, and I’ve applied these skills across team-based, leadership, and solo development projects - each one sharpening my ability to collaborate, take initiative, and solve design challenges.

Looking for a position within the industry to contribute fresh ideas, grow within a collaborative studio, and help bring compelling player experiences to life.
